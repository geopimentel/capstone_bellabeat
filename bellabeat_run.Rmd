## <span style="color:#FA8072"> 3. Prepare Phase </span> <a class="anchor" id="prepare_phase_3"></a> 

#### 3.1 Dataset used: <a class="anchor" id="dataset_used_3_1"></a> 

The data source used for our case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made available through Mobius. 

#### 3.2 Accessibility and privacy of data: <a class="anchor" id="accessibility_and_privacy_of_data_3_2"></a> 

Verifying the metadata of our dataset we can confirm it is open-source. The owner has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.
You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

#### 3.3 Information about our dataset:<a class="anchor" id="information_about_our_dataset_3_3"></a>  

These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.  Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.  

#### 3.4 Data Organization and verification: <a class="anchor" id="data_organization_and_verification_3_4"></a> 

Available to us are 18 CSV documents. Each document represents different quantitative data tracked by Fitbit. 
The data is considered long since each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows.Every user has a unique ID and different rows since data is tracked by day and time. 

Due to the small size of sample I sorted and filtered tables creating Pivot Tables in Excel. 
I was able to verify attributes and observations of each table and relations between tables. Counted sample size (users) of each table and verified time length of analysis - 31 days. 


|Table Name |Type |Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dailyActivity_merged | Microsoft Excel CSV | Daily Activity over 31 days of 33 users. Tracking daily: Steps, Distance, Intensities, Calories |
|dailyCalories_merged | Microsoft Excel CSV | Daily Calories over 31  days of 33 users |

| weightLogInfo_merged | Microsoft Excel CSV | Weight track by day in Kg and Pounds over 30 days. Calculation of BMI.5 users report weight manually 3 users not.In total there are 8 users |

#### 3.5 Data Credibility and Integrity:<a class="anchor" id="data_credibility_and_integrity_3_5"></a> 

Due to the limitation of size (30 users) and not having any demographic information we could encounter a sampling bias. We are not sure if the sample is representative of the population as a whole. 
Another problem we would encounter is that the dataset is not current and also the time limitation of the survey (2 months long). That is why we will give our case study an operational approach. 

# <span style="color:#FA8072">  4. Process Phase </span> <a class="anchor" id="process_phase_4"></a> 
 
I will focus my analysis in R due to the accessibility, amount of data and to be able to create data visualization to share my results with stakeholders. 

### 4.1 Installing packages and opening libraries <a class="anchor" id="installing_packages_and_opening_libraries_4_1"></a> 

We will choose the packages that will help us on our analysis and open them. 
We will use the following packages for our analysis: 

*instal tidyverse
* readr
* here
* skimr
* janitor
* lubridate
* ggpubr
* ggrepel
* ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggpubr)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggplot2)
```
### 4.2 Importing datasets <a class="anchor" id="importing_datasets_4_2"></a>

Knowing the datasets we have, we will upload the datasets that will help us answer our business task. 
On our analysis we will focus on the following datasets: 
 
 * Daily_activity 
 * Daily_sleep 
 * Hourly_steps
 
Due to the the small sample we won't consider for this analysis Weight (8 Users) and heart rate (7 users)

```{r}
daily_activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read_csv("hourlySteps_merged.csv")
```
### 4.3 Preview our datasets <a class="anchor" id="preview_our_datasets_4_3"></a>
 
 We will preview our selected data frames and check the summary of each column. 
 
```{r}
head(daily_activity)
str(daily_activity)

head(daily_sleep)
str(daily_sleep)

head(hourly_steps)
str(hourly_steps)
```
### 4.4 Cleaning and formatting <a class="anchor" id="cleaning_and_formatting_4_4"></a>

Now that we got to know more about our data structures we will process them to look for any errors and inconsistencies. 

#### 4.4.1 Veryfying number of users

Before we continue with our cleaning we want to make sure how many unique users are per data frame. 
Even though 30 is the minimal  sample size we will still keep the sleep dataset for practice only. 

```{r}
n_unique(daily_activity$Id)
n_unique(daily_sleep$Id)
n_unique(hourly_steps$Id)
```
#### 4.4.2 Duplicates

We will now look for any duplicates:

```{r}
sum(duplicated(daily_activity))
sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))
sum(duplicated(hourly_steps))
```
#### 4.4.3 Remove duplicates and N/A

Knowing the length of our observations (daily_sleep 413) we are able to delete duplicates for daily_sleep. 

```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na()

daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na()

hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na()
```
We will verify that duplicates have been removed

```{r}
sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))
```
#### 4.4.4 Clean and rename columns 

We want to ensure that column names are using right syntax and same format in all datasets since we will merge them later on. We are changing the format of all columns to lower case. 

```{r}
clean_names(daily_activity)
daily_activity<- rename_with(daily_activity, tolower)
clean_names(daily_sleep)
daily_sleep <- rename_with(daily_sleep, tolower)
clean_names(hourly_steps)
hourly_steps <- rename_with(hourly_steps, tolower)
```
#### 4.4.5 Consistency of date and time columns

Now that we have verified our column names and change them to lower case, we will focus on cleaning date-time format for daily_activity and daily_sleep since we will merge both data frames. Since we can disregard the time on daily_sleep data frame we are using as_date instead as as_datetime

```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  rename(date = activitydate) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))

daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  rename(date = sleepday) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date,format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))
```



We will check our cleaned datasets

```{r}
head(daily_activity)
head(daily_sleep)
```
For our hourly_steps dataset we will convert date string to date-time.

```{r}
hourly_steps<- hourly_steps %>% 
  rename(date_time = activityhour) %>% 
  mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time,format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))

head(hourly_steps)
```
### 4.5 Merging Datasets <a class="anchor" id="merging_datasets_4_5"></a>

We will merge daily_activity and daily_sleep to see any correlation between variables by using id and date as their primary keys. 
```{r}
daily_activity_sleep <- merge(daily_activity, daily_sleep, by=c ("id", "date"))
glimpse(daily_activity_sleep)
```
# <span style="color:#FA8072"> 5. Analyze Phase and Share Phase </span> <a class="anchor" id="analyze_phase_5"></a>

We will analyze trends of the users of FitBit and determine if that can help us on BellaBeat's marketing strategy. 

### 5.1 Type of users per activity level <a class="anchor" id="type_of_users_per_activity_level"></a>

since we don't have any demographic variables from our sample we want to determine the type of users with the data we have. We can classify the users by activity considering the daily amount of steps. We can categorize users as follows:

* Sedentary - Less than 5000 steps a day.
* Lightly active - Between  5000 and 7499 steps a day. 
* Fairly active - Between 7500 and 9999 steps a day.
* Very active - More than 10000 steps a day. 

Classification has been made per the following article <https://www.10000steps.org.au/articles/counting-steps/>

First we will calculate the daily steps average by user.

```{r}
daily_average <- daily_activity_sleep %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarise (mean_daily_steps = mean(totalsteps), mean_daily_calories = mean(calories), mean_daily_sleep = mean(totalminutesasleep))

head(daily_average)
```
We will now classify our users by the daily average steps. 

```{r}
user_type <- daily_average %>%
  mutate(user_type = case_when(
    mean_daily_steps < 5000 ~ "sedentary",
    mean_daily_steps >= 5000 & mean_daily_steps < 7499 ~ "lightly active", 
    mean_daily_steps >= 7500 & mean_daily_steps < 9999 ~ "fairly active", 
    mean_daily_steps >= 10000 ~ "very active"
  ))

head(user_type)
```
Now that we have a new column with the user type we will create a data frame with the percentage of each user type to better visualize them on a graph.

```{r}
user_type_percent <- user_type %>%
  group_by(user_type) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  mutate(totals = sum(total)) %>%
  group_by(user_type) %>%
  summarise(total_percent = total / totals) %>%
  mutate(labels = scales::percent(total_percent))

user_type_percent$user_type <- factor(user_type_percent$user_type , levels = c("very active", "fairly active", "lightly active", "sedentary"))


head(user_type_percent)
```
Below we can see that users are fairly distributed by their activity considering the daily amount of steps. We can determine that based on users activity all kind of users wear smart-devices.

```{r}
user_type_percent %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="",y=total_percent, fill=user_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1)+
  coord_polar("y", start=0)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x= element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=14, face = "bold")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#85e085","#e6e600", "#ffd480", "#ff8080")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = labels),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
  labs(title="User type distribution")
```

### 5.2 Steps and minutes asleep per weekday <a class="anchor" id="steps_and_minutes_asleep_per_weekday"></a>

We want to know now what days of the week are the users more active and also what days of the week users sleep more. We will also verify if the users walk the recommended amount of steps and have the recommended amount of sleep. 

Below we are calculating the weekdays based on our column date. We are also calculating the average steps walked and minutes sleeped by weekday. 

```{r}
weekday_steps_sleep <- daily_activity_sleep %>%
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(date))

weekday_steps_sleep$weekday <-ordered(weekday_steps_sleep$weekday, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday",
"Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

 weekday_steps_sleep <-weekday_steps_sleep%>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarize (daily_steps = mean(totalsteps), daily_sleep = mean(totalminutesasleep))

head(weekday_steps_sleep)
```

```{r}
ggarrange(
    ggplot(weekday_steps_sleep) +
      geom_col(aes(weekday, daily_steps), fill = "#006699") +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 7500) +
      labs(title = "Daily steps per weekday", x= "", y = "") +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)),
    ggplot(weekday_steps_sleep, aes(weekday, daily_sleep)) +
      geom_col(fill = "#85e0e0") +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 480) +
      labs(title = "Minutes asleep per weekday", x= "", y = "") +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
  )
```
In the graphs above we can determine the following: 

* Users walk daily the recommended amount of steps of 7500 besides Sunday's. 

* Users don't sleep the recommended amount of minutes/ hours - 8 hours. 

### 5.3 Hourly steps throughout the day <a class="anchor" id="hourly_steps_throughout_the_day"></a>

Getting deeper into our analysis we want to know when exactly are users more active in a day.

We will use the hourly_steps data frame and separate date_time column.

```{r}
hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>%
  separate(date_time, into = c("date", "time"), sep= " ") %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) 
  
head(hourly_steps)
```

```{r}
hourly_steps %>%
  group_by(time) %>%
  summarize(average_steps = mean(steptotal)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x=time, y = average_steps, fill = average_steps)) + 
  labs(title = "Hourly steps throughout the day", x="", y="") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```
We can see that users are more active between 8am and 7pm. Walking more steps during lunch time from 12pm to 2pm and evenings from 5pm and 7pm.

### 5.4 Correlations <a class="anchor" id="correlations"></a>

We will now determine if there is any correlation between different variables: 

* Daily steps and daily sleep
* Daily steps and calories 

```{r}
ggarrange(
ggplot(daily_activity_sleep, aes(x=totalsteps, y=totalminutesasleep))+
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Daily steps vs Minutes asleep", x = "Daily steps", y= "Minutes asleep") +
   theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text( size=14)), 
ggplot(daily_activity_sleep, aes(x=totalsteps, y=calories))+
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Daily steps vs Calories", x = "Daily steps", y= "Calories") +
   theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text( size=14))
)
```
Per our plots: 

* There is no correlation between daily activity level based on steps and the amount of minutes users sleep a day. 

* Otherwise we can see a positive correlation between steps and calories burned. As assumed the more steps walked the more calories may be burned. 


### 5.5 Use of smart device <a class="anchor" id="use_of_smart_device"></a> 

#### 5.5.1 Days used smart device <a class="anchor" id="days_used_smart_device"></a>

Now that we have seen some trends in activity, sleep and calories burned, we want to see how often do the users in our sample use their device. That way we can plan our marketing strategy and see what features would benefit the use of smart devices. 

We will calculate the number of users that use their smart device on a daily basis, classifying our sample into three categories knowing that the date interval is 31 days: 

* high use - users who use their device between 21 and 31 days. 
* moderate use - users who use their device between 10 and 20 days. 
* low use - users who use their device between 1 and 10 days. 

First we will create a new data frame grouping by Id, calculating number of days used and creating a new column with the classification explained above.

```{r}
daily_use <- daily_activity_sleep %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize(days_used=sum(n())) %>%
  mutate(usage = case_when(
    days_used >= 1 & days_used <= 10 ~ "low use",
    days_used >= 11 & days_used <= 20 ~ "moderate use", 
    days_used >= 21 & days_used <= 31 ~ "high use", 
  ))
  
head(daily_use)
```
We will now create a percentage data frame to better visualize the results in the graph. We are also ordering our usage levels. 

```{r}
daily_use_percent <- daily_use %>%
  group_by(usage) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  mutate(totals = sum(total)) %>%
  group_by(usage) %>%
  summarise(total_percent = total / totals) %>%
  mutate(labels = scales::percent(total_percent))

daily_use_percent$usage <- factor(daily_use_percent$usage, levels = c("high use", "moderate use", "low use"))

head(daily_use_percent)
```
Now that we have our new table we can create our plot: 

```{r}
daily_use_percent %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="",y=total_percent, fill=usage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1)+
  coord_polar("y", start=0)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x= element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=14, face = "bold")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = labels),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#006633","#00e673","#80ffbf"),
                    labels = c("High use - 21 to 31 days",
                                 "Moderate use - 11 to 20 days",
                                 "Low use - 1 to 10 days"))+
  labs(title="Daily use of smart device")
```
Analyzing our results we can see that 

* 50% of the users of our sample use their device frequently - between 21 to 31 days. 
* 12% use their device 11 to 20 days. 
* 38% of our sample use really rarely their device. 

#### 5.5.2 Time used smart device <a class="anchor" id="time_used_smart_device"></a>

Being more precise we want to see how many minutes do users wear their device per day. 
For that we will merge the created daily_use data frame and daily_activity to be able to filter results by daily use of device as well. 

```{r}
daily_use_merged <- merge(daily_activity, daily_use, by=c ("id"))
head(daily_use_merged)
```
We need to create a new data frame calculating the total amount of minutes users wore the device every day and creating three different categories: 

* All day - device was worn all day. 
* More than half day - device was worn more than half of the day. 
* Less than half day - device was worn less than half of the day. 

```{r}
minutes_worn <- daily_use_merged %>% 
  mutate(total_minutes_worn = veryactiveminutes+fairlyactiveminutes+lightlyactiveminutes+sedentaryminutes)%>%
  mutate (percent_minutes_worn = (total_minutes_worn/1440)*100) %>%
  mutate (worn = case_when(
    percent_minutes_worn == 100 ~ "All day",
    percent_minutes_worn < 100 & percent_minutes_worn >= 50~ "More than half day", 
    percent_minutes_worn < 50 & percent_minutes_worn > 0 ~ "Less than half day"
  ))

head(minutes_worn)
```
As we have done before, to better visualize our results we will create new data frames. In this case we will create four different data frames to arrange them later on on a same visualization. 

* First data frame will show the total of users and will calculate percentage of minutes worn the device taking into consideration the three categories created. 

* The three other data frames are filtered by category of daily users so that we can see also the difference of daily use and time use. 

```{r}
minutes_worn_percent<- minutes_worn%>%
  group_by(worn) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  mutate(totals = sum(total)) %>%
  group_by(worn) %>%
  summarise(total_percent = total / totals) %>%
  mutate(labels = scales::percent(total_percent))


minutes_worn_highuse <- minutes_worn%>%
  filter (usage == "high use")%>%
  group_by(worn) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  mutate(totals = sum(total)) %>%
  group_by(worn) %>%
  summarise(total_percent = total / totals) %>%
  mutate(labels = scales::percent(total_percent))

minutes_worn_moduse <- minutes_worn%>%
  filter(usage == "moderate use") %>%
  group_by(worn) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  mutate(totals = sum(total)) %>%
  group_by(worn) %>%
  summarise(total_percent = total / totals) %>%
  mutate(labels = scales::percent(total_percent))

minutes_worn_lowuse <- minutes_worn%>%
  filter (usage == "low use") %>%
  group_by(worn) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  mutate(totals = sum(total)) %>%
  group_by(worn) %>%
  summarise(total_percent = total / totals) %>%
  mutate(labels = scales::percent(total_percent))

minutes_worn_highuse$worn <- factor(minutes_worn_highuse$worn, levels = c("All day", "More than half day", "Less than half day"))
minutes_worn_percent$worn <- factor(minutes_worn_percent$worn, levels = c("All day", "More than half day", "Less than half day"))
minutes_worn_moduse$worn <- factor(minutes_worn_moduse$worn, levels = c("All day", "More than half day", "Less than half day"))
minutes_worn_lowuse$worn <- factor(minutes_worn_lowuse$worn, levels = c("All day", "More than half day", "Less than half day"))

head(minutes_worn_percent)
head(minutes_worn_highuse)
head(minutes_worn_moduse)
head(minutes_worn_lowuse)
```
Now that we have created the four data frames and also ordered worn level categories, we can visualize our results in the following plots. All the plots have been arranged together for a better visualization.

Per our plots we can see that  36% of the total of users wear the device all day long, 60% more than half day long and just 4% less than half day. 

If we filter the total users considering the days they have used the device and also check each day how long they have worn the device, we have the following results: 

Just a reminder:

* high use - users who use their device between 21 and 31 days. 
* moderate use - users who use their device between 10 and 20 days. 
* low use - users who use their device between 1 and 10 days.

High users - Just 6.8% of the users that have used their device between 21 and 31 days wear it all day. 88.9% wear the device more than half day but not all day. 

Moderate users are the ones who wear the device less on a daily basis. 

Being low users who wear more time their device the day they use it.

Bellabeat's mission is to empower women by providing them with the data to discover themselves.

In order for us to respond to our business task and help Bellabeat on their mission, based on our results, I would advice to use own tracking data for further analysis. 
Datasets used have a small sample and can be biased since we didn't have any demographic details of users. Knowing that our main target are young and adult women I would encourage to continue finding trends to be able to create a marketing stragety focused on them. 

That being said, after our analysis we have found different trends that may help our online campaign and improve **Bellabeat app**: 

|Recommendation| Description |
|---| ---|
|1. Daily notification on steps and posts on app| We classified users into 4 categories and saw that the average of users walk more than 7,500 steps daily besides Sundays. We can encourage customers to reach at least daily recommended steps by CDC - 8.000 **sending them alarms if they haven't reached the steps and creating also posts on our app explaining the benefits of reaching that goal**. As CDC explains the more steps you walk the lower is the mortality rate. We also saw a positive correlation between steps and calories.|
|3. Notification and sleep techniques| Based on our results we can see that users sleep less than 8 hours a day. **They could set up a desired time to go to sleep and receive a notification minutes before to prepare to sleep**. Also offer helpfull resources to help customers sleep - ex. breathing advises, podcasts with relaxing music, sleep techniques.|
|2. Reward system | We are aware that some people don't get motivated by notifications so we could create a kind of game on our app for a limited period of time. **Game would consist in reaching different levels based on amount of steps walked every day**. You need to maintain activity level for a period of time (maybe a month) to pass to the next level. For each level you would win certain amount of stars that would be redeemable for merchandise or discount on other Bellabeat products.|



On our analysis we didn't just check trends on daily users habits we also realized that just 50% of the users use their device on a daily basis and that just 36% of the users wear the device all time the day they used it. We can continue promote Bellabeat's products features: 

* Water-resistant  
* Long-lasting batteries 
* Fashion/ elegant products 

You can wear the products everyday to any occasion without worrying about the battery.
